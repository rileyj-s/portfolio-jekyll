Problem & Solution
------------------
The Hispanic Family Center in Murfreesboro Tennessee was in need of a re-design for their website. Their site at the time, was a WordPress site that was set up in a basic way but the overall aesthetic had no character; the director wanted it to be more lively.

In the product I made her, I wanted them to have a simple site that represented their family friendly character. In the design, layouts were kept simple and neat and presentations clear. When it came to functionality with their dynamic content, I focused on keeping it user-friendly when it came to how their content was displayed and made.
