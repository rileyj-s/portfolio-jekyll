Problem & Solution
------------------
Redeemer Church Mufreesboro is a church plant in Mufreesboro TN. They were in need of a refresh when it came to their web site and the platform it was on. Initially their site was a simple setup but not a developed design, the experience did not work well on mobile devices and the impression was not clearly expressed.

In addressing this problem, I wanted to understand the most important kinds of information that wanted included on the site. Once I was clear, I did a lot of rough sketches of the content organization until the best arrangement was discovered. From there I went into wireframing, design concepts, and then development.

 I wanted to provide Redeemer with a site that was user-friendly in how they edited/created their content as well as a site that expressed their personality in a clearer way. The content they put out needed to presented in a clean and modern way that felt casual and friendly.
