Problem & Solution
------------------
Covenant Seminary had an old, static webpage that displayed popular spots in the St. Louis
city area for prospective students. The navigation was confusing and the design did not
reflect the overall site's design. The solution that needed to happen was a more user-friendly and
aesthetically coherent page.

I documented how the rest of the site functioned and wanted to pull in common interactions into the new page. I also wanted the navigation to be simple and not the headache it used to be, so I brought in a category menu as a well as a sidebar navigation in order that the user wouldn't get exhausting in scrolling through the amount of info.
