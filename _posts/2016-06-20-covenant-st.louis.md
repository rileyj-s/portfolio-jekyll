Problem & Solution
------------------
Covenant Seminary had an old, static webpage that displayed popular spots in the St. Louis
city area for prospective students to see. The navigation was confusing and the design did not
reflect the overall site's design. The solution came to be a more user-friendly and
aesthetically coherent page.

<div class="example-container">
<img class="example-img" alt="St. Louis Page" src="/assets/images/web-covenant/st-louis-intro.png">
</div>

<div class="example-container">
<img class="example-img" alt="St. Louis Intro" src="/assets/images/web-covenant/event-section.png">
</div>

<div class="example-container">
<img class="example-img" alt="St. Louis Events" src="/assets/images/web-covenant/st-louis-grid.png">
</div>
