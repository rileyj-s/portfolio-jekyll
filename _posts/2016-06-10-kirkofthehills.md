Problem & Solution
------------------
Kirk Of The Hills is a local church in St. Louis, MO. The church was wanting to update their logo which was mainly their name in Adobe Garamond Pro. In this update, the church was hoping to have an identity that represented their audience in a more effective way. Their audience had a combination of traditional and modern values, and their current logo was resembling mainly the traditional group.

With their solution, the Church wanted an option of 3 logos representing a different aspect of their church. I took these parameters and took a lot of inspiration from the architecture/steeples of their church, as well as the clean aesthetic that is displayed throughout the chapel, which in the end brought a conclusion of a logo that stays true to their modern and traditional groups.

*The logo is still in a decision phase, so none of these are official*
