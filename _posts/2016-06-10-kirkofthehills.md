Problem & Solution
------------------
Renraku is primarily a music label, but also a media Media Corporation with the purpose of creating quality content for its audiences. The problem they had was that they needed an identity for their brand. Renraku had never had a logo before so this was a big step for them resembling an image.

In solving this, I started with how they wanted their personality to presented and also the values thy wanted to represent. Communication, cyber-punk, and bold were all influential factors they wanted embodied in their identity. After the tone was set, research was gathered forming a style and moodboard which brought momentum in iteration and final executions.
