Problem & Solution
------------------
Mosso was a project for a fictional client. Mosso is a lifestyle brand that needed a identity and a mock up for its professional store. There audience was combined of male and female ranging from 24-40 years old.

Mosso represents a delicate motion which ties into why thee logo embodies a swift bird. For the site, I researched a lot of other professional name brands and how they portrayed their products along with their brand. I wanted to take the inspiration from the use of serifs I saw, neat looking photos, and organization of content which transformed into the mockup presented.
