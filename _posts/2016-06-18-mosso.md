Problem & Solution
------------------
Mosso was a project for a fictional client. Mosso is a lifestyle brand that needed an identity and a mock up for its professional store. Their audience was combined of male and female ranging from 24-36 years old.

Mosso represents a delicate motion which ties into why the logo embodies a swift bird. For the site, I researched a lot of professional name brands and how they portrayed their products along with their brand. I took a lot of inspiration from the use of serifs, neat looking photos, and organization of content, in order to have a satisfying design.
